 Basic script to help you with the top 10 things i usually do after new Fedora install .
 
  After you download the file , Extract it , open the folder and make the "install_all" file  executable with :
 
 chmod +x install_all 
 
 or right click on the file , go to the permissions tab and check the "make executable"
 
 Before you run the script make sure you DID Update your system  with :
 
 sudo dnf update -y
 
 and then I recomment to restart you PC ( if this is your very FIRST time running the Update)
 
 Then right click in the folder where your "FEDORA" file is and from the drop-down menu choose the Open Terminal Here , Then type in the Terminal :
  
 ./fedora
 
 enter your password and follow the Questions for What you need to install !
 
 Enjoy  and i hope this helps you a little  :) !
