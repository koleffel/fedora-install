 Basic script to help you with the top 10 things i usually do after new Fedora install .
 
 First change the name of the file (for example fedora => fedora.sh) 
 
 After you download the file , make it executable with :
 
 chmod +x fedora.sh (or whatever your file name is )
 
 Before you run the script make sure you DID Update your system :
 
 sudo dnf update 
 
 and then I recomment to restart you PC ( if this is your very FIRST time running the Update)
 
 run the script in the treminal : (make sure you place the file from where you want it to run it )
 
 ./fedora.sh
 
 enter your password and .. wait until is finished 
 
 Enjoy !
